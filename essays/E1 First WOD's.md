<h1>Browser History 1</h1>
<p>When I first tried to start the first WOD I had no idea what to do, I ended up watching the video and after watching it I felt pretty comfortable that I could do it on my own. I ended having to try twice and on both of the attempts I got stuck and did not finish within the time period. During the 3rd attempt I finish within 13 minutes. What I used in the BH1 was nothing new, but things I really think I needed to work on more so that I could remember them better.</p>
<h1> Browser History 2</h1>
<p>For BH2 I had some issues with the CSS and the linking of the CSS in the index.html, the first few times I tried this I did not know why it was not working. I tried to look for both a css validator and a html validator to see that I was linking them together the right way and that there was nothing wrong with my css. Both of these showed nothing wrong which made me very frustrated. What I later realized is that for the changes to work I had to stop the server and restart it again and then follow the link that it shows instead of refreshing the page, I am still not sure if this is because I did something wrong or not. In total this took me 6 attempts and I finished the last attempt in 6 minutes.</p>
<h1> Browser History 3</h1>
<p>For BH 3 I had a lot of issues similar to the ones in BH2, that what I wrote in VS code did not want to work, and show in the page. What I ended up doing in my final attempt was that I had watched the video to see that I was actually doing it the way that I was supposed to do, and I was but since it still did not want to work I wrote the code in VS code and when it did not work, I inspected the page and changed the code straight from the chrome developer tool as well to the same as I had written in VS code and this made the page look the way that I wanted it to look. In total this took me 4 attempts the first 3 I did not finish since the page did not turn out the right way, but on the final attempt this took me 12 minutes to finish.</p>
