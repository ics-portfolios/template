As the field of computer science broadens, it is becoming ever important to specialize in a particular discipline. I find the fields of high-frequency trading, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving to be the most interesting. However, in my opinion, the most important disciplines are ones that not only yield profit, but also have a positive impact on the world. I plan to eventually launch a start-up that meets both of these requirements.

AngelList founder Naval Ravikant has mentioned that there are 3 types of leverage: money, people, and technology. Money and people (ex: employees working for you) must be given to you or obtained over a long period of time because these two things can not be created (legally). However, with technology, you are able to access the minds and wallets of users and customers all across the world. I plan to use software to leverage good ideas and, as a result, yield a profit.

However, it is also equally important to have a positive impact on the world. I believe how one makes their money is more important than how much money they make. During my last few hours of life, I think it will comfort me to know that I left the world in a better condition than it was in when I arrived. Because of this, my entrepreneurial endeavors will not only be profitable, but also based around an idea that contributes to the moving train of society.

Starting a software company is difficult but is doable with enough hard work and drive. It’s impossible to know everything you’ll need to know prior to actually launching a profitable company, but as long as you have some knowledge to use as a foundation, building on top of it is simply a matter of time and concentrated effort. Over the next few years, I plan to develop these foundations for things like building/managing projects and find my startup idea.
