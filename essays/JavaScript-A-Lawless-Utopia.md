  Throughout my academic experience, I've studied multiple programming languages including: Java, C/C++, Python, and HTML. After much experience in these compiled languages, my first week programming in JavaScript has left me with some strong opinions. 
  
  My favorite part of JavaScript so far is its ease of use. More specifically, JavaScript does not require the user's input to be as specific as it would be in another language like C++. Simply put, JavaScript does not have as many rules as C++. For example, In JavaScript, I can define a variable of type "let", regardless if the character is a string, integer, or character. This makes the language easier to learn, as the user no longer has to remember as many variable types. Furthermore, there are many different ways to type the same thing using JavaScript. In some (but not all) instances, when accessing a property of an object in JavaScript, the user can use dot notation or bracket notation to achieve the same result. This allows the user more freedom to write their code in a syntax that they prefer, and allows for users to have their own unique style. Lastly, JavaScript makes some tasks much easier than if they were done using another language like C++. Take the JavaScript unshift() function for example. This function will add an object to the beginning of an array of your choosing. If one were to do this in C++, they would have allocate memory for a new array, add the desired object to the beginning of the new array, and then append the items of the old array into the new array. This is just one way to solve this problem, but it clearly requires more steps in C++ than in JavaScript.
  
  On the other hand, with this ease of usability comes the potential for errors. Although C++ is said to have more rules, many of these rules are in place to protect the user from themself. For example, using variable type "let" in JavaScript might be easier for the user when initially learning the language, but may fail to protect the user at runtime when the user assigns a float value to a variable meant to hold an integer value. Furthermore, without these errors, debugging the code will be a much more painstaking process. Additionally, I believe programming an intermediate project in C++ requires the user to have a decent understanding of memory allocation. This level of understanding makes the user a more well-rounded programmer.
  
  In summary, I feel the tools and simplicity that JavaScript offers are both powerful and beneficial to the coding world. However, I also feel that this simplicity can lead to unexpected coding errors and a lack of genuine programming comprehension amongst new programmers choosing JavaScript as their first programming language.
