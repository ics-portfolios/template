summary: My team in Math 372 analyzed driving data on the islands of Hawaii to see which island had the worst drivers.

For this project, our group was able to choose whatever topic we wanted to study and analyze. We looked around for large amounts of data, and after talking with some people at the Hamilton Library on UH Manoa, we found a website that provides tons of traffic data in Hawaii. Per island, it gave us annual accidents, fatal accidents, types of cars, age of drivers, etc. We took this data, separated it into islands, and used a predefined metric to see which island had the worst drivers. We took a ratio between average miles driven per vehicle and the amount of accidents. The island with the least miles driven and most accidents was deemed the worst driving island.

We used Python to help scrub through endless excel spreadsheets, and a program called MiniTab to analyze and calculate standard deviation, average, along with other statistical metrics we had been learning in the class. In the end, the island with the worst driving on average was the big island, Hilo. We hypothesized that it would be Oahu, but although Hilo had a pretty low average miles driven value, it had a relatively high annual fatal crash value.
