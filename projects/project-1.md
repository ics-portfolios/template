I worked on this project by myself during the Spring 2020 semester. It is the back-end of a mobile app that helps users calculate how many of the remaining (unshown) cards can strengthen their poker hands.  After recieving their cards and looking at the flop, the user would be prompted to enter a number that corresponds with how many possible cards can strengthen their current hand. It is written in Java, and makes good use of Object Oriented Programming with objects like "hand, deck, player, and card". I have decided to move on to more profitable ventures in lieu of writing the front-end of this app, but I feel it is a good representation of my Java coding abilities. 

The hardest part about this project was the fact that I originally didn't account for "double-counted cards". For example, I had to figure out how to prevent the program from double counting an "8 of hearts" if that card would give you both a flush and a straight. I also gained an appreciation for very detailed planning, as my lack of planning forced me to rewrite a lot of code. Below is a link to a video of me explaining the project.
