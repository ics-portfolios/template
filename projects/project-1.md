Minecraft is a game, where you find and make your own fun. You can play alone or with friends on online servers, and some servers offer many different experiences for the player. One of these experiences that my friends and I took upon ourselves was to make so much money in a server that we would just ruin the economy. In this Minecraft server, one can sell & purchase various things, meaning one could create a farm for a certain item to sell for money. So the first problem came upon us was what was the most efficient item to farm and sell to get the most money in the shortest amount of time. The answer to this was melons, and so we started theory crafting the best melon farm that could be created, scaled it up, and spent hours selling melons.

Now for the time, our current set-up was generating a good amount of money, enough such that we could overtake the richest player on the server, but tragedy struck. As people noticed our personal assets growing, they became determined to find out where our money was coming from, so they could reap the benefits for themselves. This lead to spying and selling information in the server, as making money was now a goal that many people had set their eyes on. The server had to then slash the sell prices on melons from the problems generated. This was not enough to stop us however, with a good amount of money on hand, we decided that it was time to stop farming the small change items and moved on to bigger fish. As we were mainly be limited by how fast we could sell items at the shop we decided to farm the most expensive item, ghast tears. Fighting through various problems that arose including: arguments, some group members losing interests, etc., we finally took top spot in the server economy. In the end we distributed the money amongst the newer players so that they could easily get started on the server.

This project may just seem like a group of people just playing a game, but there was much to take from our experience in setting a goal to claim top spot in a server economy. We learned how people may act hostile when it comes to a competition and may resort to various tactics such as espionage. From this we found how important information is when it came to this sort of competition, and how to solve various problems when trying to create optimized farms and such. It was a fun experience that I still look back on.
