summary: Playing a TicTacToe game against an AI.
---

In this project I contributed to a program that creates TicTacToe rules and gives the computer instructions on how to play TicTacToe (with the exception of the UI). The program treats the game of TicTacToe as a search problem, and uses different concepts to solve it including: utility, minimax, and recursion. The AI is sometimes able to beat the user, but the user can never beat the AI.


This project helped me develop my skill of working alone, and gave me hands-on experience of coding using the AI concepts associated with search problems. Below is a link to a youtube video of the program.
