My roommate and I submitted this program as our final project for our Introductory programming class with Java. It is a side scrolling game that uses sprite sheets and moves images through a program written by a UH Grad student called "EZ.java". The object of the game is to collect as many coins as you can while avoiding the hazards. 

Though the presentation of the game needs work, the project was helpful in teaching us basic programming concepts like Object Oriented Programming. Below is a link to a youtube video demonstrating the project.
